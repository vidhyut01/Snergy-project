        <h3>Starters</h3>
        <p>Well, a small dish of food or a drink taken before a meal or the main course of a meal, these tit-bits of food are known to increase appetite and thus known as Appetizers, which is just English to the French word Ap√©ritif or Hors d'oeuvre or simply a Starter in colloquial.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <span class="icon">üç±</span>
        <h3>Maincourse</h3>
        <p>The main dish is usually the heaviest, heartiest, and most complex or substantial dish in a meal. The main ingredient is usually meat, fish or another protein source. It is most often preceded by an appetizer, soup or salad, and followed by a dessert.In the United States and Canada (except Quebec), the main course is traditionally called an "entr√©e".English-speaking Qu√©b√©cois follow the modern French use of the term entr√©e to refer to a dish served before the main course.According to linguist Dan Jurafsky, North American usage ("entr√©e") retains the original French meaning of a substantial meat course.</p>

        <h3>Desserts</h3>
        <p>Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods, such as confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur; however, in the United States it may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items regarded as a separate course elsewhere. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.</p>
